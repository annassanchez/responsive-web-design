<!--html5 introduced a number of new elements that give developers more options while also incorporating accesibility featurers.
<main> is used to wrap the main content. there should only be one per page. sorounds the information related to the central topic of your page. it's not meant to include the elements that appear repeated across pages, such as navigarion links and banners.
<article> is another element that adds semantic meaning to your mark-up. article is a sectioning element, used to wrap independent, self-containded content. ex: blog entries, forum posts, news articles...
<section> is for grouping thematically related content; not the same as the article. an article can contain a group of sections, as a book has a group of chapters.
<div> can be used when there's no relationship between groups of content.  -->
