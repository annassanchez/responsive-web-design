  /*flex items in a flex contariner sometimes don't fill all the space -- you can tell CSS how to align and space out the flex items.
  -justify-content: center; sets the elements in the center, no need to occupy the full container.
  -flex-end: alings the items to the end of the container. in a row, pushes the elements to the right. in a column, pushes the elements to the bottom part of the container.
  -flex-start: alings the items to the dtart of the container. in a row, pushes the elements to the left. in a column, pushes the elements to the top part of the container.
  -space-between: aligns the items to the center of the main axis. the first and the la elemenets are pushed to the edges of the container. 
  -space-around: similar to space-between, byr the first and last item are not in the edge of the container but distributed around it
  -space-evenly: distributes space evenly between the flex items with a full space at either end of the container*/
